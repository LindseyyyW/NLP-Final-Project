# NLP-Final-Project
## GenMC+ Context Clue Generation
OpenBook QA is an open-source NLP dataset that consists of elementary science questions. GenMC (Huang et al. 2022) motivated the idea of context clues with a pre-trained transformer used for clue generation and a reader that uses the clues for choosing an answer. We improved the model's performance by changing the base models, adding context to the pre-trained encoders, and fine-tuning the hyperparameters.
